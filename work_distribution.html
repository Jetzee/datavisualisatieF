        <h2>Work Distribution</h2>
        <p>Our method of communication during this project consisted of seminars (werkcolleges), meetings, and additional consultation over text. In our first meeting, each team member presented a dataset along with at least two different perspectives. We then chose the subject and data that best suited the requirements for the project. Our first step after determining the subject was to clean and merge the datasets from each year to form one singular dataset. We also started to discuss possible graphs that could be made to support the different perspectives. We then started making the graphs and worked on a story that builds a narrative around them, which led to our draft version. Furthermore, the remaining time has been used to further improve the graphs as well as the story. Finally, with the help of the given peer feedback, we created the final data story.</p>

        <h3>Abel</h3>
        <p>Abel took the responsibility of coordinating the project. He kept track of the to-do items every week and ensured that everyone was on schedule. Abel participated in making the visualizations and was actively involved in the coding work alongside Mitchel. He also played a crucial role in writing the work distribution and summarizing the feedback received during our weekly group reflections.</p>

        <h3>Mitchel</h3>
        <p>Mitchel was responsible for creating and managing the GitHub repository. He cleaned and merged the subsets into a single dataset, ensuring the data was ready for analysis. Mitchel, along with Abel, did all the coding work and made the visualizations. He also contributed significantly to the discussions during our Tuesday meetings, helping to reflect on the progress and plan the next steps based on the feedback received.</p>

        <h3>Wybe</h3>
        <p>Wybe focused on the storytelling aspect of the project. He was instrumental in developing a strong narrative to accompany the visualizations, ensuring that the story was engaging and coherent. Wybe worked closely with Jetze to integrate the story with the data visualizations, and he regularly contributed to refining the storyline based on feedback.</p>

        <h3>Jetze</h3>
        <p>Jetze set up the Jupyter book environment where all the codes were inserted and executed. He ensured that the environment was well-organized and accessible for the team. Jetze also worked on the storytelling, collaborating with Wybe to develop the narrative and integrate it seamlessly with the visualizations. His technical setup facilitated smooth collaboration and code execution throughout the project.</p>
