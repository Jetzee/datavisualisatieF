        <h1 id="peer-feedback">Peer Feedback</h1>
        <p>Last Tuesday, our team gathered with other groups for a peer feedback/presentation session. During this session, each group presented their work from the past three weeks, followed by a feedback exchange. This exercise provided us with valuable insights into what was done well and areas that needed improvement.</p>
        <h2>Main Compliments</h2>
        <p>The main compliments we received for our data story were already good visualisations and a clean layout for our data story website.</p>
        <h3>Feedback from Groups and TAs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visualization Enhancements:</strong> Improve visualizations by adding more dimensions and making them more sophisticated.</li>
            <li><strong>Combining Perspectives:</strong> Integrate and let the two perspectives argue against each other to create a better data story.</li>
            <li><strong>Explaining Visualizations:</strong> Provide more detailed explanations for each visualization to enhance understanding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After receiving this feedback, our team recognized the value of these suggestions and took immediate steps to implement them.</p>

        <h1 id="self-reflection">Self-Reflection</h1>
        <p>Reflecting on the feedback, we made several key improvements to our data story:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Visualizations:</strong> We revisited our visualizations, adding more dimensions and complexity. This included incorporating parallel coordinates diagrams and detailed heatmaps, allowing for a richer, more layered analysis of the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Combining Perspectives:</strong> We restructured our narrative to explicitly compare and contrast the two perspectives on crime rates and socioeconomic factors. By doing this, we ensured that each perspective directly addressed the counterpoints of the opposing viewpoint, creating a more engaging and comprehensive analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Clearer Explanations:</strong> We provided thorough explanations for each visualization, breaking down complex charts into more digestible parts and linking the visual data back to our main arguments. This helped to create a clear narrative throughout the presentation, making the insights more accessible and impactful.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These changes not only addressed the feedback but also significantly enhanced the quality and coherence of our data story. By integrating these improvements, we ensured that our analysis was robust, well-argued, and visually compelling.</p>
        <p>Overall, the feedback from our peers and TAs was very important in restructuring our project. It highlighted areas where we could improve and provided clear directions on how to enhance our work. This process of iteration and redevelopment has been invaluable in helping us create a more effective and engaging data story.</p>
