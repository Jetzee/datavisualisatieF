<h1>Exploring the Impact of Socio-Economic Factors on Crime Rates in the United States</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The rise of technology and the increase in availibility of data has started a trend of data driven decision making. Data-driven insights are in recent days the most important facets in making informed decisions for governments and organisations. Governments and organisations collect a lot of data in the age of information. This can be financial data from markets, travel data and online behaviour. Data collection and the right use and the right visualisation of that data gives valuable insights in the state of affairs. Thatâ€™s also why are our current project is very important for us as students in our professional years. Being able to work with data, visualize data, interpret data and having good judgement about what the person working with the data is trying to tell will be a very helpful skill throughout our future.</p>
<br>
<p>As a group we started of the project with coming together and deciding on what datasets we were going to use. Every team member had to look for two datasets that were interesting to them and are quality datasets that would be great to work with. We also found it very important that we could hypothetically visualize a great story together before we started working with the datasets. We came to the conclusion that we would like to work with big datasets related to a country and chose two datasets related to the United States. In particular one dataset related to crime data and the other on economic and demograpic data. 
</p>

<br>
<p>This data story will explore these two datasets: the crime data with population and crime rate, and the American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2015 and 2017. The crime data focuses on various types of crime rates across different counties, while the ACS data provides a comprehensive overview of demographic and economic characteristics at both the county and census tract levels.
</p>
<p>In more detail, we will examine the relationships between crime rates and socio-economic factors such as population demographics, income, and employment.
