        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The rise of technology and the increase in availibility of data has started a trend of data driven decision making. Data-driven insights are in recent the days the most important facets in making informed decisions that in politics and organisations. Two very important data sets that are looked at a lot in government are crime rates and socio economic conditions in a country. These datasets provide a detailed view of the factors influencing crime rates and socio-economic conditions at both the county and census tract levels.
<br><br>
This data story will explore two such datasets: the crime data with population and crime rate, and the American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2015 and 2017. The crime data focuses on various types of crime rates across different counties, while the ACS data provides a comprehensive overview of demographic and economic characteristics at both the county and census tract levels.
<br><br>
In particular, we will examine the relationships between crime rates and socio-economic factors such as population demographics, income, and employment.
